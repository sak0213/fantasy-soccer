next steps:
 - get player schedules
 - forecast difficulty of a future player's week
 - get my own team data & free agency data
 - pick what available players will have the easiest week compared to their ppg/ppm and opponent difficulty

 - any way to scrape starting lineups to see if a player is even playing?
 - reddit/social media sentiment?
